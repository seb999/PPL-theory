Amplitude, wavelength and frequence

the higher the frequence is, the shorter the wavelength is

VHF 30-300 Mhz

To transmit information there is 2 way:
-modulation Amplitude
-modulation of frequency (FM : variaton of the wave length )

Propagation of radio wave 3 way:
-in line
-following the curve of the earth
-like a pool ball by reflection on ionosphere

Disturbances of radio wave
-radio shadow (like in the hangar)
-simultaneous transmission
-precipitation weaken the radio signal

Example de calcule
Feq = C/Wave length(lambda)

lambda = c/freq
if frequence is 118.1 Mhz
lamdba = 3x10^8 / 118.1

300 000 000 / 118 100 000 = 2.54

---------------------
Calcul how far in advance can you contact Malmo
R = 1.225(sqrt(H) + sqrt(h))



    The altitude of the aircraft is 6000 feet
    The altitude of the tower is insignificant
    R = 1.225(âˆš6000)
    R = 1.225 x 77,5
    R = 95 nautical miles
