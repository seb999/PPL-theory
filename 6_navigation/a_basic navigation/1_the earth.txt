Pole 0.3% shorter than equator 
axis of earth 23,5 degrees lean from sun orbit 

DISTANCE 
350 degrees 
1 degrees = 60 minutes 

1NM = 1852 meters = 1 degrees
1 English Mile (SM : status mile) = 1609 Meters 
1 Km = 1000 meters 

Circonference 40 003 km 

COORDINATES 
Latitudes, longitudes, Arcuate distance 

LATITUDE : 
Arcuate distance between equator and latitude parallele 
Origine of latitude is equator 

LONGITUDE 
Meridian, origine greenwich 
London is arcuate distance between prime meridian and another meridian 

GREAT CIRCLE 
shortest way between 2 place on the earth surface. 
It passes by center of earth 
Great circle cut meridians in deference angle
so you have to adjust direction all the time 
Only on Meridian or equator you don'y need adjustement 

RHUMB LINE 
You just calculate the track between your starting point 
and arrival point. You cut all meridian with same angle 
But it is not the shortest distance 

SMALL CIRCLE 
they are longitude lines 

CALCULATIONS 
1 degrees = 60 nautical miles 
Example distance between  53°34'N 015°12’E and 61°12'N 015°12'E 
=61°12'N - 53°34'N = 7°38'. 7° x 60 + 38' = 458 NM.
