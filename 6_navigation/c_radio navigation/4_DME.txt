Distance measuring Equipement
Invented in Australia in 1950
962 - 1213 MHz (UHF)

But to facilate usage, we use the same frequency as the VOR to set it up 
108.0 - 117.95 MHz 

A query station in the aircrast that send a pulse
A responce station on the ground (Can be combinated with NDB or VOR) that send a reply 63Nhz more

It measure the slant range and not the ground distance. 200NM distance max

accuracy of Â± 0.25 NM + 1.25 % of the slant range

When you fly straight over the beacon you get your altitude and
6000fett = 1NM so you read 1. DOn't use it if you are to close to it (ex: Alt 6000feet, stop using it when it indicaate dstance 6NM)

Erros
Use VHF so high relief can block the system
-Mountaain
-Shadow from obstacle 
-it neasure distance from aicraft to ground and not ground distance
