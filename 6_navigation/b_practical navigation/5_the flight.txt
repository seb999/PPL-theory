Drift calculation
drift x 60 /Distance accomplished + drift x 60 / Remainding distance 

Descent calculation 
method 1 : 3 time thousand of feet example 3x7000feet = 3x7 = 21NM 
method 2 : use decent rate that is usually 500 feet / minute
            example you want to descent 5000 feet so you need 10 minutes you calcultae 
            with your ground speed the distance 90nm / 60 x10 15NM
