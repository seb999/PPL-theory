Turbo charger to maintain optimum mix in carbu for high altitude flight 
Wastegate to avoid too much pressure 

Modern aircraft use FADEC 
to regulate fuel injection 
Get data from the ECU(engine control unit) 

To start the engine :
-primer a bit
-trottle 1cm
-don't pump to avoid carbu fire 
-10 second only and stop 
-if not started, re do same procesdure 

-20 to 50 ppm during carbu heat check and magnetos check 
If not, then danger to manipulate propeller when engine is stop 
And not a good idea to fly with no carbu heat working 


Maintenance every 50 hours 
Engine life 2400 hours of flight

The more it is cold the more the viscosite increase
