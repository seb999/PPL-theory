Static pressure
Airspeed 
Altimeter 
Vertical speed 

Total pressure
Airspeed (pitot)

The air pressure decrese by 1hPa per 27 feet

QFE : height above a terrain.
Will always show 0 at the ground

QNH: altitude above the sea Level
So we get the altitude above sea of the terrain

STD : when abstaxle doesn;t manner anymore
1013hpa for all planes

Air speed indicator show the IAS (Indicated air speed)
Correction must be applied to get the CAS (Calibrated air speed)
Air density change with altitude

Variometer
