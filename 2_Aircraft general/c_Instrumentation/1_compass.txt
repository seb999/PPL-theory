4 categories of instruments
-Magnetic compass
-Pressure instruments
-Gyro instruments
-Engine instruments

Compass show the magnetique north 
Different than the geographic north

The megnetic lines make the compas to point to the fround 
To avoid this we put a weight 
The weight is as low gravity point 

Mettalic equipement of the plane create a deviation
Use the deviation table to adjustedIt is called deviation swing

ANDS :
WHen you fly East or West 
If you accelerate compas point to the north 
If you deccelerate, it point to the south 

UNOS :
WHen you turn norh you undershot the reading 
When you turn south you Overshot the reading

Difference between Magnetic and geographic north is called Variation 
Perturbation due to metlalic plane is called deviation
