Flight control
-primary flight controls
-secondary flight controls

primary : you manoeuvre the aircraft
secondary : facilitate the pilot (flaps, trim)

Power control:
-for big airplane we use hydrolic fluid 3000 PSI
water is not compressible but will freeze
We use fire resistant synthetic fluid

ELEVATORS
they control the pitch of the aircraft

AILERONS
control the bank of the aircraft
controled by the yoke. We increase the lift on on side or the other, the plane bank and turn
The problem is that it creates also grag on the opposite and the plane turn on the opposite direction
You can have a differential gear in the aileron system that will cause the ailerons that goes down to have less 
deflection than ailerons that goes up

RUDDER

FLAPS 

TRIM 

BALANCE TABS 
-it reduces the imput when you manoeuvre the controls
-for instance on cessna you have servo tap on the ELEVATORS

LOCK controls
