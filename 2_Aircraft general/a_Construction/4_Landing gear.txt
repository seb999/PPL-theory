Landing gear

    Manoeuvre the aircraft on the ground
    Absorb the forces upon landing
    Establish clearance for propellers and flaps

Shock absorbers
can be hydrauic/ pneumatic 
can be spring steel 

Breaks
disc break mounted on rear wheel

Nose wheel
The nose wheel's primary task is to stabilize and steer the aircraft on the ground.
Vibration can desintegrate the wheel at high speed
We install a shimmy damper or jazz damper to fix this problem

Tyres
nothing special to say

Retractable gears
reduced drag
