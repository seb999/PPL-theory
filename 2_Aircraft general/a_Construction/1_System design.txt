SYSTEM DESIGN
the pilot manauel AFM
the pilot operating handbook POH

DESIGN CONCEPTS
Fail-Safe (if not working properly the plane still fly ex : breaks)
Safe-life (will never break during the life of the plane)
Damage-tolerant (part of plane can accept damages, like a crack in a window)
Load factor

LOADS AND IMPACTS
g force
limit factor, over it the aicraft can be damaged (+3.8 / -1.52g)
ultimate load, over will cause the structure to break

Strengths and stress
Tension
Compression
Shear (cisaillement)

Maintenance
maintenance programme or periodidicity like every 50 hours for cessna
If engine has not been used for long period, it require an inspection
Corrosion control every 5 years

Componenets
Components of an aircraft have different time limit
