Formation de precipitation 
-  coalescence effect : water droplets collide each other and grow bigger 
- Ice crystal effect : ice crystall raise moisture from subcooled dropplet

Precipitation  : 
1) rain (RA): 
    drizzle (DZ), 
    steady rain (NS), 
    shower of rain (CB),
    freezing rain To receive freezing rain, the rain needs to come from an inversion layer where you have plus degrees above a cooler layer.
2)Snow (SN)

3)Sleet (SNRA)
  neige mouille. Reduce visibility for VFR 

4)Hail (GS for small and GR for big) 
     The hail falls like showers and are easy to detect and fly around 

5)Snow grain (SG)
    Drizzle that has frozen and become snowy grains

6)Ice pellets (PL)
