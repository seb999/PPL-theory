1 ) From pression gradient
created between high to low pressure. 
More isobar close more pression gradien force high ?(wind) 

2) Coriolis effect 
  The air in north emisphere deflect to the right
  It dosn't go straight from High to low pression 

3)Geostrophic wind 
  The wind is in reality parallele to isobar and depression at right if you face the wind 

4) Centrifuge force 
    At high pressure the centrifuge force is added to the 
    pressure gradient and wind is stronger 
    At low pressure, the centrifuge is remoed from rpession gradient 
    and wind speed decrease

The fiction layer 
    this friction layer is between 2 - 3 000 feet above 
    the surface. And if you leave the surface up to 
    3 000 feet, the wind turns 30° to a higher degree 
    and the wind speed will doubles. 
    If, on the other hand, you go from 3 000 feet and 
    down to the ground again, of course, the reverse 
    will happen, so the wind will veer by 30° and 
    the speed will decrease to 50 %.
