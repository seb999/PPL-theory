ATMOSPHERE:
On a la proportion de gas : azote, Oxygene, gas rare 
On a les differente couche :
    -troposfere  36 000tf / 11000m
    -tropopause
    -stratosphere
    -mesosphere
    -ionosfere

AIR PRESSURE 
1013.25 hPa at sea level 
at 18 000 feet pression est la moitier 
diminue de 1hPa / 27 feet 

TEMPERATURE :
3 source of heat : 
    -radiation
    -conduction
    -advection

Water from gas to liquid will release heat 

Inversion :
 - Ground inversion : form usually during the night with clear sky 
                        or warm air that move on top of cold ground 

- Frontal inversion : when cold air remains below warmer air 
-Subsidence inversion : In high pressure system, cold air sink from higher level
-Turbulence inversion

TEMPERATURE
Cx1.8 + 32 = Kelvin 
temperature decrease by 1.98 Degree / 1000 feet
