How to create a CB 

-Unstable layers (air temp decrease rapidly with altitude)
-Humidity 
-Heaving (force that initiate the lift : during summer it is the heat)
-Air colision (2 air mass converge at low altitude)

CB RISKS 
1) Shower of rain 
2) Turbulence and ice 
3) micro burst 

How to create a CB 
-air

METAR 
-ISOL (less than 50% of sky covered by CB)
-OCNL (50 to 70% covered)
-FREQ (more than 75% )
-EMDB (CB not visible and emdebed in other clouds)
-OBSC (Obscured : hidden by other clouds like Haze or Smoke)
