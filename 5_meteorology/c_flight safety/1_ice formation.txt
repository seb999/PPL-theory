Meilleurs condition pour de la glass est de voler dans les nuages 
Mais pas seulement! 

For ice we need sub zero temperature, but if the skin of the plane is bellow zero you can also have 
ice 

for VFR pilotes the bigger risk is freezing precipitations 
Example sub zero temp and it start to rain 

Freezing rain sometimes falls from inversion, Higter it is warm and it rain, and below 
it is below zero and it turn in ice  

But you can even have ice in an inversion when there is no cloud and precipitation.
Example, you climb in an inversion with a cold aircraft. The warm air contain so much moist that it 
turn in ice on the fuselage (sublimation : water vapor to ice)

We have 3 types of ice 
-clear ice : freezing rain drops 
-Rime ice : water dropplet that freeze when they hit the fuselage 
            (in clouds or fog, easier to avoid)
-Hoar ice : frost cause by water vapor sublimation on wings  

To summarize, you can say that clear ice is formed by freezing 
rain and forms a transparent layer of ice. Rime ice is formed 
in clouds and fog and produces a snowy ice formation, 
mainly on the front edge of the wings. 
Hoar ice is formed by sublimation when water vapor freezes 
directly to a frost layer. Both clear ice and rime ice are 
easy to avoid because they require visible conditions while 
hoar ice may also occur on a clear winter day.

RISKS :
Bigger danager is reduced lift (lift reduce and drag increase) 
Form drag and friction drag 

A sandpaper layer will reduce lift by 30% !!!!

3 way of de-icing :
bleed hot air taken from engine, boots that you inflate, holes to spread de-icing liquide
