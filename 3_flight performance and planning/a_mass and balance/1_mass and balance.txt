MTOM : Maximum take off mass 
MLM : Maximum Landing Mass 
MZFM : Maximum Zero Fuel Mass 
 
 to calculate Masse before take off 
 1) Calculate mass without fuel  
 BEM + Passenger + Baggage < MZFM 
 
 2) Then you add the fuel  
 Upper result + fuel < MTOM 
 
 3) Then you calculate the landing masse in regards to consumption 

-------------------
 To use Standard Weight by passenger from ICAO 
 1) 5 seats plane at least
 2)used for commercial usages 
-----------------------
 Then the center of gravity 
Add balast if necessary 
 
 LIMITATIONS
 The limit load factor 
 Ususally +3.8g -1.52G 

 BALANCE
Center gravity forward, more consumption and more stability
Center gravity backward, less consumption and less stability
