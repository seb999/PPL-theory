Take off distance:
from brake released to 50feet altitude
At speed 20% higer than stall speed 
100% of the runway can be used 

MASS 
Heavy aircraft will need more runway
-more spped needed
-more friction on ground 
-slower acceleration 
-slower climbing 

WITH flaps
-can take off at slower speed
-less friction 
-More drag 
-Climb slowly
So you take of earlier but climb at slower speed 
Retact flat at 300 feets 

surface
-grass +10%
-water +20%
-wet snow +10%
-dry snow +5%

Density Altitude is very important to calculate 

Wind in nose is good
you decrease distance by 1% for each nds 
you increase distance by 4% for each tailwind
