Use chart to calculate 
-Head wind 
-Cross wind 
-Calculate IAS if static taken from inside 
-Calculate CAS with or without flaps 
-Calculate Stall speed 

-Calculate Take-off distance 
1)Calculate pressure-Altitude of airport 
2)what surface (paved, grass...) 
3)Mass of aircrast 
 
 -Or Calculate max mass for take off 
 1)take runway length 
 2)take wind 
 3)Mass aircraft 
 4)Temperature 
 You get the mass 

 -Calculate Vertical speed 
 (economic or maximum climb)
 use chart with 
 1)Temperature 
 2)Mass of aircraft 
 3)targeted Altitude
 You get the vertical spped feet/min  

-Climb (use eco or best climb)
1)Get pressure-altitude you targete 
2)Remove Altitude depart 
3)Get result in table with mass aircraft
4)Apply coorection -10% for 10 degrees bellow Standard 

-Engine power 
1)With temperature 
2)Pression-altitude
3) % of power you want 
You get number of RPM to set on engine 

-Cruise 
(choose best eco or best effect flying type) 

-Endurance 
with atitude and %power you get the endurance 

-Descent 
Use chart with Altitude and read time 
Do the same with Airport Altitude 
Substract both values 

-Landing 


-Landing
