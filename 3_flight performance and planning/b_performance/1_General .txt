Performance are in EASA part NCO

Performance influence by 
 Mass, Center of Gravity,
 Runway condition, meteo 

Pression altitude:
27feet for each hpa lower than 1013
Ex airport at 4000 feet QNH 993
Will have pressure altitude 4000 + (27x 20)

Density altitude:
2degrees by 1000feet

and 1 degree different from standard 15 degree = 120 meters
