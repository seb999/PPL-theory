Best gliding speed
Should be in theory same as Vy 
But there are other factors that influence the gliding speed 

And we prefer the speed for longer distance than speed for longer time 

Best gliding speed is at the top of the power curve

We can also calculate the duration of descent with sink rate 
ex: 4500 feet to descent with 500feet/min = 9 min descent
