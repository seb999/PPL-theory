Vref = 30% above stall speed 
ncreased mass affects landing by:

    Higher speed
    Larger momentum
    Better braking effect

Flaps :
-give more drag 
-so we can have steeper descent 
-lower stall speed 
-create drag during role out 
-but  less mass on the landing gear as it create lift 

Decrese distance of 10% for each 9nds
